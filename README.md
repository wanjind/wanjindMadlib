Plants are very( intriguing) living organisms. Although a lot of research is dedicated to (elders) in comparison to plants, there should be more research for this amazing life forms. These green organisms show a wide range of variety from insect (judge) to parasitic ones to unicellular ones. They give us beautiful (nuts), necessary nutrients no wonder mums still insist on more (aliens) on the plate and what about (bowls) all other life would not survive with it. However, the most amazing thing is how they survive all their life being sessile and stuck to the same location. Come (apple) or sunshine, danger or no danger, bad weather or good weather. Despite their limited chances to escape from danger they have elaborate pathways to (dance) to all ‘enemies’ they encounter. My (best) is a desert plant named tree tumbo whose lifespan is up to 1000 years and can survive for years without rain.
